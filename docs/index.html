                The game is played with a keyboard. After a brief introduction to the game’s story the player starts the game playing as a cursor in starting tutorial area (the CPU). From there they proceed to the first level. At first they don’t have any special abilities. The cursor can only do a basic dash attack. By playing the first level the player obtains the first special ability - shooting. Most of the abilities that the player can acquire are used for solving puzzles and fighting enemies.
